# Regression Analysis on Fuel Efficiency vs. Vehicular Mode of Transmission (AT/MT)

This is a brief PDF document that looks into the relationship between fuel efficiency and mode of transmission of an automobile. The study is part of the final week's peer-graded assingment section where students and submittees are required to establish and analyse a mathematical relationship between fuel consumption given in miles per gallon (mpg) and the effect of mode of transmission on that effiiciency figure.

## Which data has been used here?

The data used here is the `mtcars` dataset provided with R itself, in the `datasets` package that comes preloaded with R when the console is loaded. You can simply load the `mtcars` data by providing `mtcars` as a single command. Its not a large dataset, rather its small with only 32 rows and 11 columns. That is, a data frame of 32 automobiles wth 11 of their characteristics recorded here. These characteristics range from things like miles per gallon, to displacement, weight in thousand pounds, so on and so forth. Of course, there is the `am` variable that signifies whether a select automobile is automatic transmission or manual. How the transmission mode influences the fuel efficiency of a vehicle will be investigated by some regression methods that I describe them here in this readme document.
